						<h2>Life Expectancy</h2>
						<p>
							Life expectancy serves as a vital measure of a population's
							overall health and well-being. Influenced by factors such as
							healthcare access, lifestyle choices, and environmental
							conditions, disparities exist worldwide. Some nations achieve life
							expectancies surpassing 80 years, whereas others lag behind at
							under 60 years. It's imperative to grasp these differences and
							collaboratively strive to elevate health standards globally.

						<h2>BMI</h2>
						<p>
							Exploring the trends of the top 10 countries with the highest BMI
							over the years provides a glimpse into the overall fitness and
							weight management of countries. As dietary habits, lifestyle
							choices, and health policies shift, this bump chart provides an
							insight into how nations grapple with weight-related health
							challenges. Understanding these patterns can guide global health
							initiatives and awareness campaigns. <br /><br />Evidently, some
							countries seem to top the charts year after year, which may
							suggest either lifestyle issues or a lack of awareness. In
							contrast, other countries seem to be improving their BMI over the
							years, which may suggest that they are taking steps to improve
							their health.

						<h2>Life Expectancy vs GDP</h2>
						<p>
							The relationship between a nation's GDP and the life expectancy of
							its citizens is complex. This bubble chart compares GDP with life
							expectancy, highlighting that while economic prosperity often
							correlates with better health outcomes, it's not the sole
							determinant. Multiple factors influence the health and longevity
							of populations, emphasising the diverse challenges in global
							health.

							<br /><br />The bubble chart also highlights the differences
							between regions, where it seems that some continents such as
							Africa generally sit on the lower end of both life expectancy as
							well as GDP per capita. This suggests that as a whole, improved
							wealth can definitely help increase the potential for better life
							expectancies.

							<br /><br />However, it is also important to note that on the
							higher end, countries with similar GDP per capita still have
							differing life expectancies. This may be due to other external
							factors.
